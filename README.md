# 🧠 Image Classification using Transfer Learning

This project implements an **Image Classification model using Transfer Learning** in Python.  
It leverages pre-trained deep learning architectures to achieve high accuracy with limited training data.

The model is trained and evaluated in the notebook **`image_classification_TL.ipynb`**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 Transfer Learning with pretrained CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG, MobileNet etc.)
- 📂 Custom dataset loading using `torchvision.datasets`
- 📊 Training, validation loops with accuracy tracking
- 🧪 Model evaluation & predictions on new images
- 💾 Model saving for deployment
